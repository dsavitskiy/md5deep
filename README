This is md5deep, a set of cross-platform tools to computer hashes, or
message digests, for any number of files while optionally recursively
digging through the directory structure.  It can also take a list of known
hashes and display the filenames of input files whose hashes either do or
do not match any of the known hashes. This version supports MD5, SHA-1,
SHA-256, Tiger, and Whirlpool hashes. 

See the file NEWS for a list of changes between releases.

See the file COPYING for information about the licensing for this program. 

See the file INSTALL for (generic) compilation and installation
instructions. Here's the short version:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

Note that you must be normally root to install to the default location.
The sudo command is helpful for doing so. You can specify an alternate
installation location using the --prefix option to the configure script.
For example, to install to /home/foo/bin, use:

$ ./configure --prefix=/home/foo

There is complete documentation on how to use the program on the 
project's homepage, http://md5deep.sourceforge.net/
